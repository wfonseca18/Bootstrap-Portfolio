                As an experienced professional in IT, I enjoy working with all aspects of technology. With a Bachelor's
                degree in Computer Information Systems from DeVry University, I have over 4 years of real-world
                experience in building applications, networking, clients/servers, analysis and design, automation
                scripting, database engineering, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, APIs and integrations. I enjoy working in dynamic
                Agile teams with different skill sets for quick delivery. From full stack development to hardware, I
                find that there is always an adventure and new discoveries waiting to be found.
                Outside of the day to day tasks, I enjoy spending time with family and friends. Anything outdoors is my
                middle name as I love being out in nature. I also find great pleasure in volunteer work and devoting
                time to the church.
